# Project: Sign-Up Form
-This project is a sign-up form created as part of The Odin Project's curriculum. The goal was to build a visually appealing and functional sign-up page from a design mockup, focusing on HTML forms and CSS styling for layout and user experience.

Description
This is a clean and modern sign-up form page with a two-column layout. The left column features a striking background image with a semi-transparent logo banner, while the right column contains the form itself. The form includes various input fields, basic client-side validation, and user-friendly focus and error states to guide the user.

Features
Responsive Two-Column Layout: The page is built with a flexible layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

Custom Fonts: Uses @font-face to implement a custom font for the logo banner.

Interactive Form Fields: Inputs have :focus states with a blue border and a subtle box-shadow for better user experience.

Client-Side Validation: The password fields use HTML5 validation (minlength and required) to ensure data integrity.

Error Styling: Invalid inputs are styled with a red border and shadow to provide immediate visual feedback to the user.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the structure and semantics of the form.

CSS3: For all styling, layout, and responsiveness.

Flexbox: Used extensively for positioning the main columns and form elements.

Custom Properties: For maintainable color schemes and spacing.

Pseudo-classes (:focus, :invalid): For interactive and dynamic styling.
